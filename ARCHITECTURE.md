## Responsibilities

Universe Engine: Build and maintain investable universe.

Pre-Filter Engine: Remove companies that do not meet baseline requirements.

Data Engine: Retrieve market and metadata through provider-agnostic sources.
Persistent caching decorates a source and can be enabled or tuned without
changing scoring or provider implementations.
The orchestration engine collects metadata and price histories in separate,
bounded-concurrency phases so filtering occurs before expensive price calls.
Transient provider failures are retried below the cache layer with bounded
exponential backoff and jitter; permanent failures pass directly to the engine.
Uncached provider calls pass through shared pacing. A rate-limit response
creates a global cooldown so concurrent workers cannot amplify throttling.
Repeated rate limits open a per-process circuit breaker, preserving unresolved
rows for a later resume instead of holding thousands of queued requests open.
Run State stores an input fingerprint, manifest, and atomic per-company
checkpoints so compatible interrupted runs can resume safely.
Completed runs containing provider errors remain resumable; successful and
analytically rejected rows are reused while only error rows run again.

Scoring Engine: Calculate Discovery Score only.

Research Engine: Generate explainable research summaries.

Reporting Engine: Export reports and serve the local dashboard. Moonshot
terminal queries read deterministic analysis, calibration, and immutable
baseline artifacts through a separate bounded store; they never initialize the
market-data or AI layers.
